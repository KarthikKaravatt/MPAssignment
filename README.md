## Machine perception assignment to test various machine learning methods effectiveness of recognising handwritten digits

In this assignment I explored different ways to classify handwritten digits. I have attempted all tasks to
completion with testing of different hyper parameters where I could. I have put the source code with each
task. I have tested the code to work on google colab and the ipynb file is in the zip file.
